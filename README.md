# Mulims on Mars

1.  **Purpose - Technical**

This is just a fun hobby project for me to learn to build a React-based blog.

2.  **Purpose - Social**

I believe that instead of romanticizing the past times, we should look forward with enthusiasm and inspire our future.

3.  **Purpose - Spiritual**

Inshallah others may find deeper connection to our religion or non-Muslims be further interested in it by seeing how our religion and science go together.

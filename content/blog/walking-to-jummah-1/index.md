Abu Hurayrah (Radi Allahu Anhu) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: "Shall I not tell you something by means of which Allah erases sins and raises people in status?" They said: Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He said: "Doing Wudu properly at times when it is difficult to do so, taking many steps to the mosque, and waiting for prayer after prayer. That is constant readiness." (Narrated by Muslim, 251)
